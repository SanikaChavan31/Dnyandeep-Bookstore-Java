# Dnyandeep Bookstore - Book Billing System

Welcome to the Dnyandeep Bookstore, a comprehensive desktop application built to streamline bookstore management and billing operations. This system provides a user-friendly interface for managing book inventory, processing sales, and tracking business performance.

## üåü Features

  * **Book Management:** Easily add, edit, and delete book records from the inventory.
  * **Intuitive Dashboard:** A central dashboard provides a quick overview of key metrics. It includes a bar chart that visualizes sales data for the past seven days, helping you track recent performance at a glance.
  * **Efficient Billing:** A dedicated billing module allows for quick and accurate processing of customer purchases.
  * **Low Stock Notifications:** The system features a notification dashboard that alerts you when books are low in stock or out of stock, ensuring you never miss a re-order.
  * **Sales Records:** Keep a detailed record of your store's performance with:
      * **Daily total sales records** for a granular view of day-to-day revenue.
      * **Monthly total sales records** presented in a convenient table format for long-term analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

  * **Frontend:** **JavaFX** for creating a modern and cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI).
  * **Backend Logic:** **Java** for handling all business logic and operations.
  * **Database:** **SQL** for data storage and management.
  * **Connectivity:** **JDBC** (Java Database Connectivity) to establish a connection between the Java application and the SQL database.
  * 
## üöÄ How It Works

The application operates on a client-server architecture. The user interacts with the JavaFX GUI, which sends requests to the Java backend. The backend, in turn, uses JDBC to communicate with the SQL database, performing actions like adding, updating, or querying data. This ensures a clear separation of concerns and efficient data handling.

## üñ•Ô∏è Database Setup

### 1\. Create the Database
### 2\. Create the Tables
### 3\. Configure the Connection

Once configured, the application should connect to the database seamlessly and function as intended.
